# Telemed-Released
The final released version of this Telemedicine project, culminated through months of work and dozens of individuals' hard labor. 
Thank you very much to Dr. Lee Ewin, Dr. Rachelle Auld, Mr. Scott Usher, Mr. Alex Cabal, Dr. Aimee French, Mrs. Tiffany Peraino,
and all the other students who have contributed. It has been an honor to work with all of you, and I hope all who reads this truly
understands it. Throughout it all, it has made me more understand the motto of "Service above Self", and I hope we can all make
this world a little better.

3. Although ChatGPT is useful for small tips and mini-projects, the overall arching vision was designed by me.
4. Function >>>>>>>> Beauty, make sure it works because abstractions are distracting and unnecessary before getting everything to work. Trust me, this is key to any kind of project building
